# #5 Operators

Operators are important for operations on operands. Go provides all the basic operation as provided in other programming languages. Here's a gist of them.

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator       | Symbol | Usage |
| :------------- | :----- | :---- |
| Addition       | +      | a+b   |
| Subtraction    | -      | a-b   |
| Multiplication | *      | a*b   |
| Division       | /      | a/b   |
| Modulo         | %      | a%b   |
| Increment      | ++     | a++   |
| Decrement      | --     | b--   |

## Concatenation

Using addition operator between strings concatenates them.

```go
fmt.Println("Attack" + " " + "on" + " " + "Titan")
// prints: Attack on Titan
```

## Relational Operators

| Operator                    | Symbol | Usage |
| :-------------------------- | :----- | :---- |
| is Equal to                 | ==     | a==b  |
| is Not Equal to             | !=     | a!=b  |
| is Less Than                | <      | a<b   |
| is Greater Than             | >      | a>b   |
| is Less Than or Equal to    | <=     | a<=b  |
| is Greater Than or Equal to | >=     | a>=b  |

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Symbol | Usage  |
| :------- | :----- | :----- |
| AND      | &&     | a&&b   |
| OR       | \|\|   | a\|\|b |
| NOT      | !      | !a     |

## Bitwise Operators

| Operator    | Symbol | Usage |
| :---------- | :----- | :---- |
| AND         | &      | a&b   |
| OR          | \|     | a\|b  |
| XOR         | ^      | a^b   |
| LEFT SHIFT  | <<     | a<<b  |
| RIGHT SHIFT | >>     | a>>b  |

## Assignment Operators

| Operator          | Symbol | Usage |
| :---------------- | :----- | :---- |
| Assign            | =      | a=b   |
| Add & Assign      | +=     | a+=b  |
| Subtract & Assign | -=     | a-=b  |
| Multiply & Assign | *=     | a*=b  |
| Divide & Assign   | /=     | a/=b  |
| Modulo & Assign   | %=     | a%=b  |

That's a wrap on day 5.
